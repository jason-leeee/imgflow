Core:
    DAG based lazy execution / eager execution
    convert ImgFlow into Cloud Dataflow and run in parallel

Data loading:

    attach extra info to a image (e.g. label)

Functionality:
    basic stat anaylsis
    basic preprocessing (e.g. resize, pad, grayscale, RGB/BGR)
    basic augmentations
    visualize bboxes, labels, etc.

Storage:
    save all intermediate results in the disk
    export to JSON COCO, PASCAL VOC, TFRecord
